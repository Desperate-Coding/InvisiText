### Inspiration
Very much thanks to [Darryl Huffman](https://codepen.io/darrylhuffman/pen/EyyNEP) who made a very nice JS library to make invisible ink. That first got me wondering whether there was a CSS-only solution.

More thanks to [Adam Ruf](https://codepen.io/adamruf/pen/GZwdrY) who experimented with different CSS thingys. This gave me the idea first to add the hovering / clicking feature.
