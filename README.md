InvisiText lets you hide text with pure CSS.

## Playground

You can play around with Invisible Ink here: [https://codepen.io/desperate-coding/pen/qXMNwx](https://codepen.io/slate-coding/pen/qXMNwx)

## Learn More

I have moved all our documentation and usage instructions to our website, [InvisiText](http://invisi-text.surge.sh).

## Notes

Note 1. InvisiText `blurred` does not work on IE or Edge yet.

## Inspiration

Very much thanks to [Darryl Huffman](https://codepen.io/darrylhuffman/pen/EyyNEP) who made a very nice JS library to make invisible ink. That first got me wondering whether there was a CSS-only solution.

More thanks to [Adam Ruf](https://codepen.io/adamruf/pen/GZwdrY) who experimented with different CSS thingys. This gave me the idea first to add the hovering / clicking feature.
